              Founded with the vision of creating an inclusive space for women in cybersecurity, our chapter 
              emerged from the recognition that diversity drives innovation in the field of information security. 
              We started as a small group of passionate cybersecurity professionals and students who wanted to 
              create opportunities for women to thrive in this critical industry.

            <p className="leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 mb-4">
              Since our inception, we have grown into a vibrant community that spans across academia and industry, 
              bringing together students, researchers, practitioners, and leaders who share a common goal: 
              advancing cybersecurity through diversity and inclusion. Our inaugural ceremony marked the beginning 
              of a journey that continues to evolve with each new member and every event we host.
